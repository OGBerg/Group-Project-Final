# Gameplay Ideas

* Player- RUN-DMC
* Enemies- Fans (with cameras)
* Power ups- Playing cards
* End goal- Get the chain

## Music

[Source Remix](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPbB9se7OPk)

* Power up would switch to real song for one chorus to play once while power is temporarily active

* Guitar riff from the remix as power up noise

## Art Style

* Fast-paced, slamming into things, lots of camera shake and particle effects

* Hotline Miami vibes, bright colors, pixel art would work (maybe parallax scrolling?)

* Hard edges

* ‘90s arcade font as opposed to a more pixel-y one

* Player is a square?

## Mechanics

* Gravity modification as a means of movement(?)

* Difficulty ramping up.

* Not jumping as much as launching

* Ceiling would be necessary to slide around on

* You get a short amount of “slow time” (hold space or something) while you’re sailing between one ground and another, but can’t change direction. (Possibly a glitch effect when this happens)

* Enemies to necessitate timing, but number of jumps is tracked for replay value
